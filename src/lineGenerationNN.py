'''
        FEATURE SCALING & ENCODING
- one-hot encode categorical variables
- normalize numericals between 0 and 1 (relu) or -1 and 1 (sigmoid)
'''


'''
        NEURAL NETWORK SETUP
- Split (80/20) and shuffle data
- Define layer dimensions
- initialize parameters
'''


'''
        ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS
- Define linear and relu algorithms along w/ their derivatives
'''


'''
        FORWARD PROP
- Define input -> output algorithm
- compute cost function
'''


'''
        BACK PROP
- Move back through network driven by cost value
- Update parameters
'''
